## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

**Yayoi Kusama, Infinity Mirrored Room –The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away, 2013**

Yayoi Kusama's immersive rooms use mirrored repetition and polka-dot motifs to generate sensory complexity and spatial expansion. I’m inspired by her use of color repetition and layering to reimagine Pacita Abad’s *Wheels of Fortune* as dynamic, rhythmically patterned digital forms that reflect cultural symbolism and variation.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

**Technique**: Array Functions in p5.js  
**Reference**: [p5.js Array Functions Tutorial](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/array-functions)

Array functions allow me to efficiently generate repeated circular forms with controlled randomness—mimicking Kusama's modular repetition and Abad's rhythmic dot systems. Each "wheel" becomes a unique object with variations in color, size, and density.
